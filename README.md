## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server Database.  
- **Silver Layer**: Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.  
- **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a **star schema** required for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

- **Data Architecture**: Designing a modern Data Warehouse using Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).  
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.  
- **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
